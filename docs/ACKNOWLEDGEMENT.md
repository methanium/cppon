C++ON is primarily developed and maintained by Manuel Zaccaria (methanium) / CH5 Design.

Special thanks to:
- GitHub Copilot â€” assistance on documentation drafts, benchmark harness refinements, and code review suggestions.
- The communities behind related JSON libraries (simdjson, RapidJSON, nlohmann/json) for inspiration and comparisons.
- Toolchains enabling robust C++ development: Visual Studio/MSVC, Clang/LLVM, GCC, and the C++ standard libraries.

Early users:
- At this stage, the only early user is the author; no external users have seen or tested the code yet.
